/*
Imagine a publishing company that markets both Book and CD's of its works. A class Publication is created that stores the title (a string) and price (type int) of a publication. From this class derive two classes:

Book, which adds a page count and author, and a constructor having title, price, pages & writer as parameters.
CD, which adds a playing time in minutes, and a constructor having title, price & length as parameters.
Each of these two classes should have a putdata() function to display its data as shown in sample output.

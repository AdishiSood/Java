/*
In fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc. The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1.

There are two ways to write the fibonacci series program in java:

Fibonacci Series without using recursion
Fibonacci Series using recursion

public static void main(String args[])  
{    
 int n1=0,n2=1,n3,i,count=10;    
 System.out.print(n1+" "+n2);//printing 0 and 1    
    
 for(i=2;i<count;++i)//loop starts from 2 because 0 and 1 are already printed    
 {    
  n3=n1+n2;    
  System.out.print(" " +n3);    
  n1=n2;    
  n2=n3;
